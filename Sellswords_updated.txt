To read all the various changes this overhaul mod adds you can read up on it at their Nexus page
https://www.nexusmods.com/battlebrothers/mods/606   Important to note here, our SS version
is based off 5.4 not the latest SS version on Nexus so we have some of the newer features missing.
-----

Required Mods.
-Latest Legends.
-Latest MSU.
-PTR is optional, our version can be played with or without it.
-AC mod is optional but there is some special hooks made by Emo for maximum compatibility.

Mod Compatibility Suggestions:
This is a major overhaul mod untop of PTR (if you're running PTR) and that untop of Legends latest.
So many submods do not work with this, keep the mod list short mainly QoL mods avoid content+,
origin mods.

A giant thank you to Necro, Emo Used HM01, Barcode and all the others who have helped develop and 
playtest SSU (Sellswords Updated).
